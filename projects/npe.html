            <h2>Not Paid Enough!</h2>
            <p>Not Paid Enough! is an exciting and highly engaging asymmetrical multiplayer party game that is currently in development by a dedicated team of 15 passionate and talented level designers, 3d graphic designers and game developers including myself. Designed specifically for PC, this game aims to provide a unique blend of humor, strategic gameplay, and chaotic moments, all set within the infamous and mysterious confines of Area 51.</p>
            <!-- <p><a href="https://github.com/iTschoCapic/modelisation_geometrique">GitHub repository</a> of the project</p> -->
             <p>Dont forget to check the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/goober-studio/">LinkedIn</a> of our project!</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In this game, one player assumes the role of an alien janitor, a prisoner trapped in the top-secret military facility and forced to clean the premises under the watchful eyes of their captors. Meanwhile, up to three conspiracy theorists, convinced that extraterrestrial life exists, infiltrate the base in an attempt to gather undeniable proof of alien existence. As the janitor, your goal is to maintain the cleanliness of the facility while preventing the intruders from uncovering secrets and making a mess. On the other hand, the conspiracy theorists must skillfully navigate the environment, collect crucial evidence, and outwit the alien janitor, all while avoiding detection and counterattacks. Both sides have access to an arsenal of quirky gadgets and tools that can be used to create hilarious and unpredictable gameplay scenarios.</p>
            <h3>Game Features</h3>
                <p><i>The game thrives on its asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where a single alien janitor faces off against three conspiracy theorists, each with their own set of objectives and tools.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>Players must think strategically and react quickly as they engage in cleaning, sabotage, and deception, creating dynamic and unpredictable matches. The game world is filled with interactive objects and sandbox elements that encourage creative problem-solving, pranks, and emergent gameplay moments. With its spontaneous and chaotic nature, Not Paid Enough! is highly replayable and ideal for streamers looking to generate engaging content. The setting, a stylized version of Area 51, is rich with secrets, humorous details, and an atmosphere that blends mystery with absurdity. Players can interact with computers by inserting floppy disks to download files, retrieve secret codes, and earn points, all while managing cooldowns and the ever-present threat of interference from the alien janitor. Additionally, conspiracy theorists have access to a camera, allowing them to capture photographic evidence of alien activity. The flash function of the camera adds an extra tactical layer, temporarily blinding opponents and creating new opportunities for escape or disruption.</p>
            
            <h3>Development Details</h3>
                <p>The game is being developed using Unity (C#) to ensure a smooth and scalable multiplayer experience. Designed primarily for PC, it has the potential for future expansion based on player interest. Despite being a team of students, we have structured our development process professionally by electing leads for each major roleâ€”development, level design, graphics, and overall project management. This leadership structure helps maintain efficiency and clear communication across disciplines. To ensure steady progress, we conduct weekly meetings where we discuss milestones, review feedback, and plan upcoming tasks. Our Agile workflow includes structured sprints and defined milestones, allowing us to adapt dynamically while keeping the project on track. Additionally, we utilize industry-standard tools such as Git for version control, Visual Studio for programming, Blender and Maya for 3D modeling and animation. Collaborative planning and task tracking are managed through Github (Issues, Kanban, Wiki for Class diagram) and Google Drive (for assets and documentation like the Game Design Document) ensuring that every team member stays aligned with project goals and deadlines.</p>
            <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>As a key member of the development team, I have played a significant role in multiple aspects of the game's creation. I was responsible for designing and implementing the interaction system (in particular the computers, which enabled conspiracy theorists to insert diskettes, launch downloads and discover secret codes (thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavien-gonin-858bb8226/">Flavien</a> for this last one)). This system is fully networked, ensuring smooth synchronization across multiplayer sessions while incorporating cooldown mechanics and alien interference to keep the gameplay balanced. In addition, I developed the camera system, which lets players take photos of evidence while ensuring that captured objects are properly within view using advanced field-of-view detection and raycasting. The flash mechanic adds further depth, giving players a way to disrupt others or create tactical advantages. My work also included fine-tuning balancing elements, optimizing state management through network variables, and refining the interaction mechanics to create an engaging and polished gameplay experience.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>This game is designed for casual gamers and party game enthusiasts looking for a lighthearted yet competitive multiplayer experience. The spontaneous and comedic nature of the gameplay makes it particularly appealing to streamers and content creators who thrive on unpredictable and shareable moments. Fans of other asymmetrical multiplayer games, such as Lethal Company, Among Us, or Content Warning, will find Not Paid Enough! a refreshing and engaging addition to their game library.</p>
            <h3>Current Development Status</h3>
                <p>With two months of development completed and two months remaining in our planned schedule, Not Paid Enough! is progressing steadily. As of March 6, we have finalized essential gameplay assets and completed at least one to two types of rooms, such as the office and laboratory. Our next major milestone is March 14, by which time we aim to have a fully functional connection loop and a finalized gameplay loop. Next weeks will be dedicated to refining our Mini Minimal Viable Product into an Minimal Viable Product, ensuring all core mechanics are integrated and the game is fully playable by March 20. Finally, by April 04, the M.V.P. should have become the game in its final, functionally complete form, allowing us to concentrate on fixing bugs, playtesting, polishing and replacing unused elements. Once this phase is complete, we'll evaluate and plan potential additional features to further enhance the experience.</p>
                <p><b>Release date : May 06, 2025</b></p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Not Paid Enough! is shaping up to be a chaotic, strategic, and highly entertaining multiplayer game. With its blend of fast-paced action, asymmetrical gameplay, and emergent comedic moments, it offers a unique experience that keeps players engaged and entertained. Being part of this project is been an exciting challenge, and I look forward to seeing how players react to the game upon its release. As development continues, I remain committed to refining and enhancing every aspect of the experience to make Not Paid Enough! a standout title in the multiplayer party game genre.</p>
